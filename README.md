By Devin Kennedy - March 2023

### Implemeted - 
  - Parse and solve a system of linear equations with n terms
  - Add, subtract, and multiply matricies
  - Multiply matricies by scalars

### To be implemented - 
  - Determine if the matrix is a vector
  - Return the tuple of planar coordinates represented by the vector 
  - Transform a vector based on a transformation matrix
